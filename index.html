                <p>Microsoft Excel, software developed and manufactured by Microsoft Corporation, allows users to organize, format, and calculate data with formulas using a spreadsheet system broken up by rows and columns. A spreadsheet is a row and column arrangement of data. A spreadsheet looks like a grid of columns and rows. In Excel, the grid is referred to as a worksheet.</p>

                	To create an absolute cell reference, type a $ before the column letter and a $ before the cell reference row number to remain the same. For example, $A$4 is an absolute cell reference for cell A4.
                <h4>Lookup Reference Function</h4>

                <p>The VLOOKUP (Vertical lookup) function looks for a value in the leftmost column of a table and then returns a value in the same row from another column you specify.</p>
